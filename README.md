# 02-Data-Science-My-Convex-Optimization

## Task

This project serves as an introduction to convex optimization tools and the implementation of root-finding algorithms. The primary focus is on optimizing a simple function and utilizing various root-finding methods and gradient descent for optimization.

## Description

The project involves:

1. Plotting and optimizing the function: \(f(x) = (x - 1)^4 + x^2\)
2. Implementing root-finding algorithms such as the Bisection Method and Newton-Raphson Method.
3. Utilizing gradient descent methods to find the minimum of the function.
4. Solving a linear problem using the Simplex algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/02-Data-Science-My-Convex-Optimization.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 02-Data-Science-My-Convex-Optimization
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the main.py file in your preferred Python environment.
2. Run the script.

    ```bash
    python my_convex_optimization.py
    ```

The script will execute and provide outputs for root-finding, optimization using gradient descent, and solving a linear problem.
